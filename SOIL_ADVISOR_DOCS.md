# Soil Advisor Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Soil Advisor is a new AI-powered feature in the Krishi Mitra application that provides intelligent crop recommendations based on soil NPK analysis and environmental factors.

## Features

### üå± NPK Analysis Input
- **Nitrogen (N)**: Input soil nitrogen levels in mg/kg
- **Phosphorus (P)**: Input soil phosphorus levels in mg/kg  
- **Potassium (K)**: Input soil potassium levels in mg/kg

### üå°Ô∏è Environmental Factors
- **Temperature**: Current temperature in Celsius
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity percentage
- **pH Level**: Soil pH value (0-14 scale)
- **Rainfall**: Annual rainfall in millimeters

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Recommendations
